# modular DIY Fume Extractor by simple-ee.com
This project was created to find a low cost alternative to expesive fume extractors 
used when soldering.  When soldering its always good practice to have the fumes
removed from your general area especially when soldering for a prolong period of 
time.  Typical low cost fume extractors are just a 120mm fan with a cheap carbon filter,
and dont get me wrong something is better than nothing but I always like to improve
anything with cost low cost in mind.

## Pictures <a name="thePictures"></a>
The images I provided is the first version I put together.  The stl/3mf files attached 
are version 2 and should be easier to assemble as the first version was assembled 
with glue vs the second version uses screws.
