# K2 24V (K2B24V10EB) by simple-ee.com
This project was created so that you can safely parallel as many K2 packs as you
want using the ideal diode approach.  It might seem like its overkill but when 
it comes to batteries and engineering at that, I tend to over design my systems
so that it will outlast my highest expectations.  Since this has a built in BMS
that uses a single port of charge and discharge, I did have to add two Ideal
diodes circuits so you will have a charge and discharge port now.  It might not be 
a problem for some of you but others it might be an inconviences.

Below is the bill of materials.  For the mosfet, it might be out of stock but
you can use any n channel mosfet that uses the LFPAK-88 footprint and is atleast
40V VDS.  I will link a couple of alternatives that work as well as other parts on the 
bom list that are not in stock.

The images I provided is the first version I put together and its been up and running
for about 1 week with todays date stamp of 2023/01/23 without any issues.
